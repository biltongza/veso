# restart.sh - Veso server restart script
# Part of the Veso project (https://github.com/vesotv)
#
# This script restarts the Veso daemon on Linux when using
# the Restart button on the admin dashboard. It supports the
# systemctl, service, and traditional /etc/init.d (sysv) restart
# methods, chosen automatically by which one is found first (in
# that order).
#
# This script is used by the Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS packages.
